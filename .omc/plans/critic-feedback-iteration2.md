[RALPLAN] Critic verdict: REJECT (Iteration 2)

## Remaining Critical Issues

1. **Focus management has TWO competing solutions** - No clear guidance on which to use
2. **Input event handlers unclear** - Doesn't specify exact replacement strategy for JSX
3. **Mutation queue recursion unexplained** - No safety explanation for recursive call
4. **Navigation handler incomplete** - Missing coordination code with TimeSlot
5. **Missing acceptance criteria** - No verification for focus management and concurrent mutations

## Required Changes for Approval

1. Choose ONE focus management solution with clear justification
2. Specify exact replacement strategy for input event handlers
3. Explain mutation queue recursion safety or use non-recursive approach
4. Provide complete navigation handler code including TimeSlot prop changes
5. Add acceptance criteria for critical fixes
